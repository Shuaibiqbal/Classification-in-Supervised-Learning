# Classification-in-Supervised-Learning
A simple classification example using Logistic Regression and the Iris dataset to demonstrate how supervised learning works in scikit-learn.

This repository contains a basic implementation of classification using the Iris dataset and Logistic Regression from scikit-learn.

**ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts:**
**Supervised Learning:** The model learns from labeled data.

**Classification:** Predicting discrete class labels (e.g., Iris species).

**Logistic Regression:** A simple linear model used for binary and multi-class classification.

**ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s inside:**
* Train/test split using train_test_split

* Model training with LogisticRegression

* Performance evaluation using accuracy_score and classification_report
